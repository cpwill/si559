<h2 id="a-list-a-part">Lessons Learned</h2>

  <h3>→ VR</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Physical prototyping methods helped me bridge the gap between 2D and 3D interactions.</li>
        <li>Digital prototyping expanded on this mindset as I learned how to directly manipulate objects on the z-axis.</li>
        <li>Use of Google Cardboard enhanced empathy for the user as I garnered spatial context within the confines of my prototype.</li>
        <li>Creative prototyping through mixed media can simulate VR interactions without advanced programming skills. </li>
      </ol>

  <h3>→ AR</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>How to accurately overlay a selection interface (store & recipe) from screen to real life point of view.</li>
        <li>Too much noise (audio and visual) on the screen during wayfinding could cause implications to the user as they are walking (e.g. avoid walking into objects by being cognizant of their surroundings.)</li>
        <li>The cause and effect of privacy in the space of AR can be problematic.</li>
      </ol>
<h2 id="a-list-a-part">Skills Gained</h2>

  <h3>→ AR</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>I found that my designs were far too static and that my ability was constrained using that tool because there was a definite learning curve for me. I found Torch to be a helpful tool to create this improved prototype because I was creating an experience on the actual device.</li>
      <li>Understanding of hand and facial tracking needed for AR to register user gestures.</li>
      <li>Ability to manipulate objects along the user's viewpoint as they move throughout a space across position and orientation.</li>
      <li>Range of tracking from active (e.g. location-based) to passive (e.g. marker-based like the Hiro exercise)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>→ VR</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Using Glitch and employing A-Frame, expanded on HTML skills to create virtual objects and specify plane position.</li>
        <li>Gained creative problem-solving skills as I wanted to show a rough version of a gaze event. To do this, I used an A-Frame mouseevent to trigger the simulation of the lecture starting.</li>
        <li>Rapid prototyping skills so that I could better present the intention of concepts with beginning programming skills.</li>
      </ol>
