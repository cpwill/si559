      <h1>tARget //
        <br>AR Mini-Project</h1>
      <p><br>
The goal of this mini-project was to spend some time familiarizing ourselves with 1-2 AR tools by working towards developing digital versions of 2-3 interactions from in-class physical prototyping.</p>

<h2 id="a-list-a-part">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>How might we leverage AR technology to create a better brick and mortar shopping experience?</p>

<h2 id="google-design">Concept Development</h2>

  <h3>→ Understanding the Problem</h3>
    <p>Explored scope in a collaborative design jam group aimed at using AR to solve for our problem statement.</p>

  <h3>→ Ideation</h3>
    <p>Compiled a list of UI elements that would feed our VR interactions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Context:</b> This concept is to be used by individuals who are shopping for recipe ingredients. It eliminates the hassle of having to search for items aimlessly by incorporating wayfinding.</li>
        <li><b>Wayfinding:</b> Indoor navigation syncs with a user’s store selection.</li>
        <li><b>Personalization:</b> Users may enable geolocation to customize their shopping experience.</li>
        <li><b>Constraints:</b> It may be hard to integrate with the selected store’s live inventory.</li>
      </ol>

      </figure>

      <p>By sketching our environment, our group was able to come together to focus on a shopping experience that uses wayfinding as an assistive tool that manipulates 3D arrows to help the user navigate through their setting.</p>

<h2 id="google-design">Physical Prototyping</h2>
  <p>To quickly bring our concept to life, we used physical prototyping to help us understand the relationship between the user's reality and simulate the AR overlay of our tARget concept. We used a range of mixed media, from paper to PlayDoh, in order to create the scenes in the below video.</p>

<h2 id="typewolf">Digital Prototyping</h2>
  <p>We explored various tools from Lens Studio to Torch AR. I settled on Torch for its seamless application within one device. I found it difficult to move from desktop to phone after using Lens Studio. for digital prototyping based on its scalability.</p>

  <p>The intended scenario is that the user would find their intended item through the wayfinding use of 3D arrows observed through their device screen. When they've found their item, the device pins celebratory confetti over the item.</p>
